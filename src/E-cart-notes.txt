                                            E-cart frontend
                                         --------------------

                            1. Create a folder ECART
                            2.Inside  that create an angular application  - ng new e-cart-frontend
                            3. cd e-cart-frontend
                            4. code .
                            5.  Run angular application - ng s -o      
                            6. clear code in app.component.html
                            7. Import 3rd party libraries
                                   ->bootstrap(index.html)
                                   ->font-awesome(index.html)
                                   ->google fonts(style.css)       
                            8. LAZZY LOADING
                                 -Lazy loading helps keep initial bundle sizes smaller, which in turn helps decrease load times.
                                 -lazy loading is an approach to limit the modules that are loaded to the ones that the user currently needs.
                                  this can improve your application's performance and reduce the initial bundle size  .
                              We have one module in our application  - app.module
                              Here we create another module - 
                               -> Generate module - ng g m products --route products --module app.module   

                            9. Component generation
                                 -> ng g c products/allProducts
                                 -> ng g c products/viewProducts
                                 -> ng g c products/wishlist
                                 -> ng g c products/cart
                                 Not in lazy loading
                                 -> ng g c header
                                 -> ng g c footer
                                 -> ng g c pageNotFound     
                            10. Setup Path
                                ->put <router-outlet></router-outlet> in app.component.html
                                ->products.routing.module.ts         

                            11.  API INTEGRATION

                                   ->import HttpClientModule in app.module.ts
                                   ->create a services inside product module for api calling 
                                         - ng g s products/services/api
                                   ->Inside api.services file,
                                         -create and use http dependency injection        
                                         -also create a function for (getallProducts()) fetching all products details
                                   ->Inside all-products.component file,
                                          -create and use api dependency injection
                                          -also create a function for integrating api services
                                          -get all products details 
                                   -> Wishlist functionality is completed

                                   ->Product search
                                       ng g p products/pipes/filter
                                       
                                ->Behaviour subjects
If the data is confined to a single component there is (almost) no need for observables. If the data needs to be shared among multiple 
components however, it is stored in singleton services. And components have no way of knowing the state of data in the service. 
So observables are used to tell the components the state of the data has been changed.
